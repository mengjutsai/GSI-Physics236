Since we'll use the EXCEL to record our data, we will also be benefit to use the spreadsheet as the calculator or tool for data analysis. 

Here are some examples to use as a calculator:

### General grading rubrics

#### If there is some weird data 

If you measure something not expected, it will be better to remeasure again and check the configuration is correct. If all stuffs are setup right, you probably need to think it detailedly why the data is not as you expect and explain in the spreadsheet. 

If the data are way different to the expected value and no explanation about the source of the error \(or uncertainty\), you will be took off points. 

#### Plotting 

* Add axis label with units
* If needed, you need to add the trend line
